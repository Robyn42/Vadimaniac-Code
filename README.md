# Vadimaniac-Code
Repository for Vadimaniacs' Heresy's project code

I added the create_venv.sh we use for class along with an updated requirements.txt.
The requirements.txt adds the pyarrow library to a virtual environment. 
Pyarrow is used to open the parquet and feather files in the Argoverse2 download. 

The preprocess.py may be usable with many different types of models.
