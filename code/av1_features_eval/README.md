# This directory maintains code intended to ensure comparability with AV1 results

Since AV2 is significantly larger, cross comparison may have little meaning.
This directory intends to keep that possibility open whenever we wish to do it.

Feature computation is based on 
Jagjeet Singh's official baseline repository for AV1
dataset, with substantial modifications
for the AV2 dataset.

Forecasting evaluation is from AV1 official API.
